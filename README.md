WolframAlpha web application with voice integration [Visit Howl!](https://mighty-lowlands-2640.herokuapp.com/)

WolframAlpha is a great resource for solving math problems, but typing in problems manually is time-consuming and often a deterrent to solving math problems. Typing in esoteric characters such as 'sqrt()' and '^' for square roots and exponents, respectively, can lead to typing mistakes and frustration. Howl uses natural language processing software that allows students to perform advanced computational problems with improved accuracy and efficiency. By integrating the WolframAlpha API with a speech-to-text software, Wit.ai, Howl is able to accept verbal inputs of mathematical operations and output both mathematical, graphical, and textual answers. Utilizing a library created from scratch, Howl has the ability to recognize shorthand phrases and multi-step problems. Another unique feature of the software is that it expands upon it's own knowledge as more requests are made, constantly expanding the library and making it more compatible to all users. This not only simplifies the process of determining mathematical solutions to everyday problems, but also provides a novel approach towards computational analysis and processing of esoteric characters.
